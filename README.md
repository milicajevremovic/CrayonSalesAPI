# Crayon Cloud Sales API  

## Overview  
This project follows **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles and implements the **CQRS** pattern with a **vertical slice folder structure**. The API integrates **Swagger UI** and ensures minimal but necessary **HTTP status codes** for clear responses.  

## Security Considerations  
For enhanced security, features like **JWT authentication**, **role-based access control (RBAC)**, and **admin-specific permissions** can be added. These aspects can be discussed further during our code review meeting.  

## Features  
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** for better separation of concerns  
- **Vertical Slice Architecture** to structure the code efficiently  
- **Swagger UI** integrated for API exploration  
- **Minimal yet meaningful HTTP status codes** for proper error handling  

## API Documentation  
Swagger UI with all required endpoints is available. You can explore the API using the attached Swagger documentation.
